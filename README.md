# ng-conf 2023 Talk Resources

When was the last time you made time to "think outside the box". We're all used to working with front-end and back-end features, APIs, databases, cloud services, CI/CD, and more, but there's a lot more to it when you make time to factor in how users work everyday. This talk from ng-conf 2023 highlights 3 areas that can take your apps to the next level:

- Minimize context shifts by bringing organizational data into your apps.
- Integrate communication capabilities directly into your app.​
- Assist users with writing, querying, reviewing, and more using AI.
